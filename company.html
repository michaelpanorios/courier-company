                <h1>About our company</h1>
                <p >FCS, member of EU Group of Companies, with a steady growth in the Greek market and extensive experience, is one of the biggest companies in the courier industry, covering everyday needs of the Greek and international labor with reliability and consistency. 

                    The Company, founded in 1986 as a limited liability company (initial legal entity), operates in the Greek market for more than 30 years, offering courier services.
                    The development of an Exclusive Representatives Network was launched immediately, as a nationwide coverage need was realized from the early beginning.
                    In September 1994, FCS has already a network of 68 points of service and its  growth is continuing, by upgrading its quality service : applies electronic detection system, develops its computerized system, connects its shops with car fleet and exclusive private flights. Since 1997 its legal entity changes and becomes S.A. 
                    Significant milestone in company’s growth path is the February 2000, when FCS becomes member of Fourye group, one of the biggest Greek commercial groups.
                    In July 2001, FCS develops a standardized Quality Management System and becomes the first company in the industry with a quality certification according to international standard ISO  9001:2008.
                    In September 2001, FCS invests in a new Sorting and Transfer Center (HUB), at the 14th km Athens- Lamia National Road, of 4.000 m2 surface.
                    In March 2002, a capital increase takes place in FCS, in which EU group takes part.
                    In 2004, the company decides to develop its branch network through a franchise system.
                    From 2006 to 2010, the company develops the franchise system and at the same time restructures its store’s appearance.
                    In 2010 FCS possesses an autonomous network of 200 shops nationwide.
                    In 2012 the FCS headquarters and sorting center are transferred in modern premises in the following address: 24, Seneka, 15th km Athens-Lamia National Road.
                    In September 2017, FCS develops an Integrated Management System by moving towards the development and implementation of an Environmental Management System together with an Occupational Health and Safety Management System according to the following  international standards ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.
                    In December 2017, EU Group aquired the shares of FCS held by Fourye SA.
                    Therefore, FCS has become a full subsidiary of  the EU Group of Companies.
                    Today, FCS operates in the highly competitive market of courier services having established a reputation as one of the biggest companies in the courier industry, offering a variety of products/services in order to cover the Greek market needs.</p>
